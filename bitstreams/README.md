# Bitstreams

FPGA Bitstreams are automatically downloaded in this directory.
Custom bitstreams can be built using [zynq-sdk](https://github.com/Koheron/zynq-sdk) repository.

If not found (e.g. offline installation), download `oscillo.bit` and `spectrum.bit` from [zynq-sdk's release](https://github.com/Koheron/zynq-sdk/releases) and move them in this directory.
